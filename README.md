# Information Management Matrix (IMM)


## Distribute Work Rollouts

IMM tracks progress of work over multiple services (codebases) and/or teams. In multi team projects it's difficult to have a realtime view of project progress.  Consider the simple example of rolling out a library upgrade across 10 services. Many organizations need to do this manually.  IMM helps keep this work visibile by tracking the progress of the rollout and regularly notifiying of progress.
